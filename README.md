# DogCatRecognizer-in-ML-.NET
This is my first look at ML .NET. 

App can recognize cat or dog. You can download already [trained model](https://github.com/KamilKoso/DogCatRecognizer-in-ML-.NET/blob/master/DogCatRecognizer%20ML%20.NETML.Model/MLModel.zip) and use it in your app. It was trained with 8000 pics of dogs and cats and it is pretty accurate.
