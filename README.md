# DogCatRecognizer-in-ML-.NET
This is my first look at ML .NET. 

App can recognize cat or dog. You can download already [trained model](https://github.com/KamilKoso/DogCatRecognizer-in-ML-.NET/blob/master/DogCatRecognizer%20ML%20.NETML.Model/MLModel.zip) and use it in your app. It was trained with 8000 pics of dogs and cats and it is pretty accurate. If you want to test my app at your own, download [DogCatRecognizer ML .NET/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/](https://github.com/KamilKoso/DogCatRecognizer-in-ML-.NET/tree/master/DogCatRecognizer%20ML%20.NET/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1) directory, and run "DogCatRecognizer ML .NET.exe" file
